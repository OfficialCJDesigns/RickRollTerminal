## Get Started
To get started hop on your favorite linux distro (mine is debian :), install "ffmpeg" using your favorite package installer "yum, packman, apt, etc". Then run ```pip install moviepy``` 

After this you will already satisfy most of the dependancies run ``` wget "https://cdn-138.anonfiles.com/l618ydVeyb/3e50a719-1675284531/video.mp4"```this will give you everything you need!
 
# The fastest way to install
i've created a installer for you 'setup.sh' this uses the package manager "apt" so if you use apt as a package installer, then run the setup!

# If you want to show support please leave a ‚≠ê
